## Project: **Garage Band with OOP**

### Author: Roger Wells

[Github](https://github.com/rsw359/pythonic-garage-band/blob/main/README.md)

In this project, we used object oriented programming in Python to create a Band made up of classes. The classes are composed of different types of musicians  that inherit properties from a superclass. Unit tests were dome in Pytest.

To Run this code, clone the repository, then enter :

python3 **pythonic_garage_band**

To run tests in the terminal, install pytest and run the pytest command in the **pythonic_garage_band**/tests directory

The two ‘plays_solo’ tests are particularly interesting because they use decorators. They were also the most difficult tests to pass.
